def runLargeMulticoreExperiment(env: Any, agents: list[Any], oracle: Any, interact: Any, timeHorizon: int=1000, nbReplicates: int=100, root_folder: str=ROOT) -> None:
    """Benchmark several agents on one environment and plot their regret.

    For each agent it runs ``nbReplicates`` independent interactions in parallel, runs the oracle for
    the same number, computes regret as the oracle's cumulative score minus each agent's, and writes 
    a logfile and regret figures under ``root_folder``. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    env : object
        Environment to benchmark on. Must expose ``name``; an optional
        ``displayname`` is used as the figure title when present.
    agents : list of object
        Agents to compare. Their ``name`` attributes must be distinct — dump
        filenames and plot legends are keyed on them, so duplicates silently
        merge two agents' results.
    oracle : object
        Reference agent defining zero regret, and the only one required to
        expose a ``policy`` (it is written to the logfile). Must belong to the
        same setting as ``agents``.
    interact : statrl.experiments.onerun.Interaction
        Interaction loop of the setting, shared by every agent in the run.
    timeHorizon : int, default=1000
        Number of rounds per interaction.
    nbReplicates : int, default=100
        Number of independent runs per agent. Regret quantiles are taken
        across these, so a handful of replicates gives a very rough band.
    root_folder : str, default='results/'
        Output directory, created if absent. Must end with a separator.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        Everything is written to disk. ``root_folder`` receives a
        ``logfile_*.txt``, one ``regret_*`` pickle per agent, and the figures
        ``Regrets_*.png`` / ``.pdf`` in linear and log-y scale. The
        intermediate ``aux_*`` dumps are deleted on the way out.

    See Also
    --------
    statrl.experiments.parallelruns.multicoreRuns : The parallel layer underneath.
    statrl.experiments.analyzeruns.computeScoreDiffs : Turns the dumps into regret statistics.
    statrl.experiments.plotruns.plotScoreDiffs : Draws the figures.

    Notes
    -----
    Cost grows as ``(len(agents) + 1) * nbReplicates * timeHorizon``. Start
    small — the defaults already amount to 100 000 rounds per agent.
