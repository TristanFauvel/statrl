class BanditAgent(ABC):
    """Base class for anytime stochastic bandit agents.

    Subclasses implement the protocol shared by every agent in
    this setting: :meth:`reset` to start an independent run,
    :meth:`select_arm` to choose an arm, and :meth:`update` to learn from the
    observed reward. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        Label used in logfiles and plot legends. Must be unique within an
        experiment, since :func:`~statrl.experiments.utils.dump` builds
        filenames from it.
    seed : int, default=1
        Seed for the agent's own randomness. :meth:`reset` re-derives
        ``np_random`` from it, so replicates are reproducible.

    Attributes
    ----------
    np_random : numpy.random.Generator
        Agent-local generator, available after the first :meth:`reset`.

    See Also
    --------
    statrl.settings.bandits.stochastic.knownhorizon.agent.BanditAgent :
        The counterpart whose ``reset`` receives the horizon.

    Notes
    -----
    Agents are deep-copied once per replicate by
    :func:`~statrl.experiments.parallelruns.multicoreRuns`, so an agent may
    hold arbitrary state as long as :meth:`reset` fully reinitializes it.
