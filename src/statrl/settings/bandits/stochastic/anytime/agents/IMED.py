    """Indexed Minimum Empirical Divergence, an asymptotically optimal bandit algorithm.

    IMED assigns every arm the index

    .. math::

       I_a(t) = N_a(t)\\,\\mathrm{kl}\\!\\left(\\hat{\\mu}_a(t), \\hat{\\mu}^\\star(t)\\right)
                + \\log N_a(t)

    and pulls the arm minimizing it. The first term is large for an arm whose
    empirical mean is confidently below the best one, the second penalizes
    arms already pulled often; minimizing their sum balances exploration
    against exploitation with **no tuning parameter** — no confidence level,
    no exploration bonus, no schedule.

    The regret matches the Lai-Robbins lower bound asymptotically [1]_, provided
    ``kullback`` is the divergence of the true reward family.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nbArms : int
        Number of arms, which must equal ``env.number_arms``.
    kullback : callable, default=:func:`~statrl.settings.utils.klGauss`
        Divergence ``kl(x, y)`` between two means. Choose it to match the
        rewards: :func:`~statrl.settings.utils.klBern` for Bernoulli,
        :func:`~statrl.settings.utils.klGauss` for Gaussian or any
        sub-Gaussian reward. A mismatched choice costs the optimality
        guarantee but stays well defined.
    name : str, default='IMED'
        Label used in logfiles and plot legends. Give two IMED instances
        distinct names when comparing divergences in one experiment.

    Attributes
    ----------
    kl : callable
        The divergence passed as ``kullback``.
    nbDraws : ndarray of shape (nbArms,)
        Number of pulls of each arm, :math:`N_a(t)`.
    cumRewards : ndarray of shape (nbArms,)
        Cumulative reward collected from each arm.
    means : ndarray of shape (nbArms,)
        Empirical mean of each arm, :math:`\\hat{\\mu}_a(t)`.
    maxMeans : float
        Best empirical mean, :math:`\\hat{\\mu}^\\star(t)`.
    indexes : ndarray of shape (nbArms,)
        Current index of each arm; :meth:`select_arm` minimizes over it.

    See Also
    --------
    statrl.settings.bandits.stochastic.batch.agents.BIMED.BIMED :
        The batched, distribution-free variant built on
        :func:`~statrl.settings.utils.KLinf_threshold`.
    statrl.settings.markovdecisionprocess.discrete_nostructure.agents.IMED_RL.IMEDRL :
        The extension of the same index to ergodic MDPs.

    Notes
    -----
    Arms never pulled have index ``0``, the smallest value the index can take,
    so every arm is played once before any is repeated. Both a pull and an
    update cost :math:`O(K)` time and :math:`O(K)` memory.
