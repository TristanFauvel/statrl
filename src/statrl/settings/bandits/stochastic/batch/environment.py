class BatchMAB(MAB):
    """Wrap a stochastic bandit into a batched one.

    Turns any
    :class:`~statrl.settings.bandits.stochastic.anytime.environment.StochasticBanditEnv`
    into an environment whose :meth:`step` consumes a whole list of arms and
    returns a list of rewards.  

    A round is a *batch*, not a pull, so the horizon of an experiment counts
    batches.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mab : ~statrl.settings.bandits.stochastic.anytime.environment.StochasticBanditEnv
        The underlying bandit supplying the arms.
    batchsize : callable or sequence of int
        Batch schedule: either ``batchsize(round) -> int``, or a sequence
        indexed by round which falls back to ``1`` once exhausted. A plain
        sequence is picklable, and so survives the process pool used by
        :func:`~statrl.experiments.parallelruns.multicoreRuns`; a lambda does
        not.

    Attributes
    ----------
    round : int
        Index of the next batch, counted from 0 since the last :meth:`reset`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from statrl.settings.bandits.stochastic.anytime.envs.parametric import BernoulliBandit
    >>> env = BatchMAB(BernoulliBandit([0.2, 0.9]), batchsize=[2, 4, 8])
    >>> info = env.reset()
    >>> info["nextbatchsize"]
    2
    >>> rewards, info = env.step([0, 1])
    >>> len(rewards), info["nextbatchsize"]
    (2, 4)
