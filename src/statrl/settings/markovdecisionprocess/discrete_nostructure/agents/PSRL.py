"""
Posterior Sampling Reinforcement Learning (PSRL).

This module implements Posterior Sampling Reinforcement Learning (PSRL),
also known as Thompson Sampling for reinforcement learning, for finite
Markov Decision Processes with Bernoulli rewards.

The algorithm maintains Bayesian posterior distributions over both the
reward function and the transition kernel of the unknown MDP. At the
beginning of every episode, a complete MDP model is sampled from the
posterior. The optimal policy of this sampled model is then computed
using Value Iteration and executed until an episode stopping criterion
is met.

The implementation follows the episodic version introduced in

    Osband, Russo and Van Roy,
    "(More) Efficient Reinforcement Learning via Posterior Sampling",
    NeurIPS 2013.

Reward distributions are modeled by Beta posteriors, while transition
probabilities are modeled by Dirichlet posteriors.

    Posterior Sampling Reinforcement Learning.

    PSRL is a Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for
    finite Markov Decision Processes.

    Rather than constructing optimistic confidence sets, PSRL maintains
    posterior distributions over the unknown reward function and
    transition probabilities.

    At the beginning of each episode, a complete MDP is sampled from the
    posterior. The optimal policy of this sampled MDP is computed and
    executed until a stopping criterion triggers the beginning of a new
    episode.

    This implementation assumes

    * finite state and action spaces;
    * Bernoulli rewards;
    * Beta priors over rewards;
    * Dirichlet priors over transitions.

    nS : int

    delta : float, optional
        Confidence parameter. Present for compatibility with the common
        learner interface but not explicitly used by the PSRL algorithm.

    Attributes
    ----------
    t : int
        Global interaction time.

    policy : ndarray of shape (nS, nA)
        Current stochastic policy computed on the sampled MDP.

    Nk : ndarray of shape (nS, nA)
        Cumulative number of visits to every state-action pair over all
        completed episodes.

    vk : ndarray of shape (nS, nA)
        State-action visit counts during the current episode.

    r_successCounts :
        Beta posterior α parameters.

    r_failureCounts :
        Beta posterior β parameters.

    p_pseudoCounts :
        Dirichlet pseudo-counts defining the posterior transition model.

    r_sampled :
        Reward function sampled from the posterior.

    p_sampled :
        Transition kernel sampled from the posterior.
