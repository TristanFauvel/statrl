"""
Comparing bandit algorithms on a Bernoulli instance
===================================================

Benchmarks IMED against uniform exploration on a three-armed Bernoulli bandit
and plots the regret of each, averaged over replicates.

This is the shape of every experiment in ``statrl``: build an environment, list
the agents to compare, add an oracle to define zero regret, and hand the four to
:func:`~statrl.experiments.massiveruns.runLargeMulticoreExperiment`.

Run with::

    python examples/plot_bandit_regret.py

Writes a logfile and regret figures under ``results/``.
