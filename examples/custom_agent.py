"""
Writing your own bandit agent
=============================

Implements a greedy agent and an epsilon-greedy one, then benchmarks both
against IMED. The point of the comparison is what greedy gets wrong: with no
exploration it can lock onto an arm that looked good early and never revisit
that decision, so its regret grows linearly on some runs and stays near zero on
others. Averaged over replicates that shows up as a wide quantile band — which
is exactly what the shaded regions in the output figure display.

Run with::

    python examples/custom_agent.py

Writes a logfile and regret figures under ``results/``.
